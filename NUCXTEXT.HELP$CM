NUCXTEXT                                                  CMS Transient command
 
Use the NUCXTEXT command to install a CMS TEXT object code file as a Nucleus
Extension. External references in the TEXT file can be resolved from libraries
specified in the GLOBAL TXTLIB list.

where:
 
name     is the name of the established Nucleus Extension.

textname is the file name of a TEXT file to be loaded. If omitted, the
         name parameter is used as the textname.  

SYstem   System free storage will be used to hold the program, and it will
         receive control disabled for interrupts and in protect key 0.
 
SErvice  Service calls are accepted (for instance a PURGE from an abend).
 
PERManent The extension cannot be dropped by a NUCXDROP  * command. It must
          be named explicitly on NUCXDROP.
 
ENdcmd   The nucleus extension receives control at normal end-of-command
         processing.
 
Push     No check to be made to see if there is already a Nucleus Extension
         of the same name.  Otherwise, an existing Nucleus Extension is not
         overridden.
 
Please note there is currently no NUCXLOAD command, because VM/370 CMS does not
have relocation information in MODULE files. However, programs can copy
non-relocatable code (without address constants) into dynamically allocated
memory and establish that code as a Nucleus Extension using the NUCEXT macro.
