SNOBOL4                                                        CMS EXEC
 
Runs the version 3.5 of the SNOBOL4 compiler as described in the
Prentice-Hall Book:- 'THE SNOBOL4 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE' (1971).
 
Format:-
 
SNOBOL4  file  <Options>
 
Where:-
 
file        Is a the sourcefile. It must have a filetype of SNOBOL4
 
Options:-
 
DISK        Keeps the printer output (File 6) on disk in file '<file> LISTING'
PRINT       Prints the printer output
TERM        Directs the printer output to the terminal
CDISK       Keeps the card output (File 7) on disk in file '<file> CARDS'
CPUNCH      Directs card output to the punch.
CTERM       Directs the punch output to the terminal.
R           The amount of storage reserved for other uses.
L           Is the low bound on dynamic storage- Default 35200
H           Is the high bound on dynamic storage - Default 20000
 
The default memory allocation is 10000.
 
The timing statistics returned by SNOBOL4 under CMS are not reliable.
 
EXAMPLES:
 
SNOBOL4 EPA
               WILL RUN A SNOBOL PROGRAM IN FILE 'EPA SNOBOL4',
               KEEPING PRINTER AND PUNCH OUTPUT IN DISK FILES
               'EPA LISTING' AND 'EPA CARDS', RESPECTIVELY.
 
SNOBOL4 VALUE CPUNCH TERM H 300000
               Will execute a SNOBOL program in file
               'VALUE SNOBOL4', directing printer output to the
               terminal and punch output to the punch.
               The compiler H value will be 300000 bytes.
