ADDRESS instruction and function

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRESS [(env [expr1]| [VALUE] expr2)]                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Temporarily or permanently change the destination environment for commands,
and possibly send a command to the new destination.

Variants:

    ADDRESS
        switches the destination environment to the previous environment.

    ADDRESS env
        switches the destination environment to the named environment.  The
        environment name is not evaluated, but rather taken as-is.

    ADDRESS env expr
        evaluates the expression and sends it to the named environment.  The
        environment name is not evaluated, but rather taken as-is.  The
        previous environment remains current after this instruction.

    ADDRESS [VALUE] expr
        evaluates the expression and switches to the environment identified
        by its value.  The VALUE keyword may be omitted if the expression
        starts with a special character.

Examples:

    address command           /* future commands go to "COMMAND" environment */
    address cms 'BANANA'      /* tell CMS to search for and run BANANA */
    editor = 'XEDIT'; address value editor  /* == ADDRESS XEDIT */
    ?editor = 'XEDIT'; address ?editor      /* == ADDRESS XEDIT */

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRESS()                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

returns the name of the current command environment.

Examples:

    ADDRESS() == 'CMS'   /* perhaps */
    ADDRESS() == 'XEDIT' /* perhaps */
